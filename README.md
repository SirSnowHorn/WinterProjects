# WinterProjects
Creating multiple cybersecurity tools over winter break.


- Using MindMax to plot activity on Google Maps

- FaceBook Active Group Finder with built in reporting

- IP sorting and mapping utilities

- GUI features for tools

- More ideas coming soon!

Might use a github.io site to host this.
